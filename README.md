I wanted to create a cool enviroment to work on my undergrad course ICS II,
so I used git as the VCS, and GNU Makefile to automate some tasks.
The language used for the projects is C, in order to be aware of the memory
management and also, get to understand some basic low-level processes, as we study
a lot of computer's organization and architecture throughout the undergrad program. 

To access the files of a project, simply switch to the branch which name matches
the project's name, as the master only contains common files.
